# Travel Planner üó∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è (Capstone) 

**Final Project of the CS50 Web Development with Python and JavaScript**

## Task üíª

To design and implement a web application of your own with Python and JavaScript. I chose to do a travel planning website that aids users in preparation for any trips while also exploring where they can travel. 

## Distinctiveness and Complexity üåü

As part of the requirements, I was supposed to make a project that is very different from all the previous ones done in the course. On top of being a unique idea, it satidfies the distinctiveness and complexity by; 
- **Allowing multiple data input:** The user is not limited to adding one activity to the itinerary or one expense to the budget at a time. They can add multiple activities and add trip expenses all at once. The user is also allowed to make multiple modifications to the itinerary and budget.
- **Containing Map integration:** Maps were added, one on the Destinations page in the Map view and one on the destination guide for each destgination. For the former, it displays markers for each available destination and for the latter, the markers for each attraction found at each place. The source map is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and *[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)* was the JavaScript library that allows the addition of maps.
- **Forcing One review per user per destination:** The app prevents the user from writing multiple reviews for each destination. Once the user has written their review, they can edit it and not add another one for a place.
- **Using stars instead of integers for ratings:** Using the `HiddenInput` field, the user selects the number of stats (e.g. 5-star, 4-star etc) and not a number.

The application was built using Django including 7 models in the back-end and utilises 3 different JavaScript scripts along with the aforementioned Leaflet for the maps. Every feature and page is mobile-responsive and this is due to adding Bootstrap 4 and custom CSS.

## Specification üìù

These are the features of the Travel Planning website;

- **Destination list** - this is basically all the destinations that the user can travel to. It is avaliable in both grid view and map view.
- **Destination guide** - for each destination, there is a description of the place, the map of the destination list of attractions, user reviews and a `Plan Trip` button for logged-in users.
- **Creating a new trip** - Speaking of which, in addition to the Plan Trip button from the destination guides, the user can go to the Create New Trip page where they can select the destination, the dates travelled and write their budget for the trip. After that, a page for their newly-planned trip will be generated.
- **Writing an itinerary** - Users can start adding/modifying items and activities to the itinerary list. This will also include the dates and the cost for each activity.
- **Writing a review** - Users can give their opinion and rating of a place using stars. They can also edit the same review if they had already wrote one for the destination, instead of writing multiple reviews.
- **Trip Budget Planner** - Users can monitor their costs and expenses for the trip and see if they are within their budget or above it.

## How to run the application üíæ

1. Clone the repository into your system
2. Ensure that you have Python and Django installed in your system.
3. Run the following ccommand `python manage.py makemigrations travel` to make migrations for the app.
4. Apply the migrations to the app by writing `python manage.py migrate`
5. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the web server.
6. Visit the website on your web browser `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
    - To log in as a user, the username is `paul` and the password is `123456`.
    - To log in as an admin, the username is `pauladmin` and the password is `Mwan1987!`.
    - Alternatively, you can just create an account by going to the Register page.
